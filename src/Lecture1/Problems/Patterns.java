//Question: Programs for printing pyramid patterns in Java (also try different patterns as your wish)


// Solution:

package Lecture1.Problems;

public class Patterns 
{
        public static void main(String[] args)
    {
// tip: println means it will print in line and when it comes to print it will continue n the same line.

        System.out.println("*");
        System.out.println("**");
        System.out.println("***");
        System.out.println("****");
        System.out.println("*****");
    }
}
